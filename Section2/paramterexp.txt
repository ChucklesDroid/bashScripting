Parameter expansion allows us to not only use values of parameters in script but to also format it according to our needs.

a) To represent text such that first letter is a lower case:
Eg: 	${name,}  

b) To represent entire text in lower case:
Eg: 	${name,,}

c) To represent text capitalized(we make use of caret symbol '^'):
Eg: {name^}

d) To represent entire text in uppercase:
Eg: ${name^^}

e) To determine the length of parameter:
Eg: ${#name}

f) To slice parameter so as to only output the specific parts you want to work with:

syntax: ${'variable_name':offset:length}
Eg: ${name:0:7} // which basically specifies the output starts from index 0 and would be 7 word length

To reference variable from the end, we would make use of negative numbers and in such case negative numbers should have a space left out.
Eg: ${name: -2: 4}

If we are not specifying the 2nd colon it would mean to represent till end index
Eg: ${name: -2}

If we are specifying the end colon, an empty string would be referenced
Eg: ${random_string: 4} //if 'random_string' does not exist then an empty string will be outputed
