In bash, there are 3 types of parameters:
a) Variables(most common)
b) Positional Parameters
c) Special Parameters


In bash, variables are of 2 types:-
a) User defined variables:- by convention, they are to be defined in lower-case.
b) Shell variables:- by convention, they are defined in upper-case.

Assigning a variable in bash:
Eg:- student="Aakarsh" { note: there is no space b/w '=' and variable name & value }

Referencing a variable in bash: We make use of parameter expansion for referrencing a variable.
Eg: Name of student is ${student} // Result is "Name of student is Aakarsh"
