Basic Calculator is used to perform integer operations. 
To make bc command run with our bash scripts to perform integer operations,we make use of echo to provide standard input to bc command.
scale parameter helps in deciding the precision by specifying the numbers of decimal points.
We seperate the scale and operation with ';'
Syntax: echo "expression" | bc

Eg: echo "scale=10; 5/2" | bc
Eg: echo "scale=2; 2/3" | bc

scale parameter should always precede the operation.
Note:- To perform exponentiation in bc, we make use of caret(^) and not ** to perform exponentiation.
