Brace Expansion consists of 2 types of lists.
a) String Lists 		// no space can be left b/w commas
Eg: {1,Aakarsh,89}
b) Range Lists: Works on consecutive values only example: numbers and alphabets.
Eg: {1..32}   // To create a range list starting from 1 to 32
echo {a..z} // To print alphabets
echo {z..a} // To print alphabets in reverse order


Range list also has step functionality. Eg:
echo {1..30..3}

Making use of leading zeroes to ensure all the expansions have same no of digits. Ex:
echo {01..30..2}

Making use of multiple brace expansions in a single command.

Ex: touch month{01..12}
Ex: mkdir month{01..12}/day{01..30}
Ex: rm -r month{01..12}/day{01..30}
