To run scripts its essential we give execute permissions to the script in question, To do that we make use of 'chmod' command.
For security reasons only user is given execute permissions !!

To give read, write and execute permissions to owner of a file and no permissions to group and others:
$ chmod 0700 'file name'

The first bit of 4 bit octal no( here 0700 ) represents special flags.
The second bit of 4 bit octal no(here 0700 ) represents read, write and execute permissions for owner.
The third bit of 4 bit octal no( here 0700 ) represents read, write and execute permissions for group.
The fourth bit of 4 bit octal no( here 0700) represents read, write and execute permissions for others.

7 = 4 + 2 + 1 (read + write + execute)
4(only read)
2(only write)
1(only execute)
6(read + write)
5(read + execute)


**Note** 
While running the script user must have both read and write permissions so that the shell can read the script.
