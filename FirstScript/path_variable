In linux to run your scripts directly from any directory without specifying the path name, we make use of PATH variable.

Eg:-
export PATH="$PATH:/mnt/sda1/GITHUB/bashScripting/FirstScript"

by adding the above line in bash.profile, the interpreter will load the above line everytime. By doing this we can run the script as command directly from command line
Like Eg:- backup_script

The above :-
export PATH="$PATH:/mnt/sda1/GITHUB/bashScripting/FirstScript"

can be broken down into following parts:
1) export is not a command rather it is built into bash itself
2) first PATH is referring to environment PATH variable
3) the string following $PATH can be explained as follows:-
For Eg:-
if initially PATH contained x:y:z (paths in PATH is seperated by ':') 
then on executing something like - export PATH="$PATH:a:b:c", the path will then be modified to contain something like-
x:y:z:a:b:c

But if export PATH="a:b:c:$PATH" is run then PATH variable will look something like this-
a:b:c:x:y:z

The order matters as those appearing on the left will be searched first for a particular command.
