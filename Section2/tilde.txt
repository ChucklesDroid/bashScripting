Tilde expansion (~) stores the full path of the user's home directory.
On a system having multiple users, to access user's home directory, we write : echo ~'usr_name'
Eg: echo ~root

Bash stores the current directory's path in shell variable "PWD" and previous path in shell variable "OLDPWD".
Eg: To change directory to previous working directory:-

cd $OLDPWD
echo $PWD

But since both $PWD and $OLDPWD are quite long to type out we instead make use of ~ expansion to do the same task.
Eg:
cd ~-  // To access $OLDPWD.
echo ~+  // To print current working directory full path.
