For our scripts to look professional it should have 5 parts as comments in the beginning of our scripts:-
1) Name of Author
2) Date Created
3) Last Modified
4) Description
5) Usage

**Note**
Both usage and description will have a line left before and after the section and details of the section will begin from next line to make
it more readable.
